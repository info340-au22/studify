                    <p>First, the user will need to created their own account for future use.</p>
                    <p>Then, we will ask them a short survey with annimation (about 10 questions) to create their own user interface base on their response.</p>
                    <p>Second, they can custom their own schedule for the week, including adding what time on specific day their homework going to be due,
                        or when their quiz and exam will happen</p>
                    <p>One special thing that our web app will make user experience more better is that they can create their own study group with their peers
                        by simply using the same platform and adding their peer name into the study room.</p>
