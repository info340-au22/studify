                    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
                    <p>Countless college students have struggled with time management for years, especially when it comes to determining the optimal time to study. Although many factors contribute to this problem, the two most common causes are poor planning and a lack of motivation--according to Dr. Jennifer Harman's <a href="https://blog.online.colostate.edu/blog/uncategorized/time-management-for-students-a-psychological-explanation-of-why-we-struggle/">Time Management for Students</a>. As a result of these factors, many students are unable to keep up with their academics, which frequently results in poor grades and, ultimately, dropping out of college. Therefore, the goal of this project is to assist students in improving their time management skills by providing them with a suitable study timetable and forming study groups based on the schedules that they input.</p>
                    <p>The online student planner <a href="https://www.mystudylife.com/">My Study Life</a>, which allows students to keep track of their classes, has inspired us to take our project to the next level. As My Study Life only organizes and notifies users of upcoming assignments and classes, our project incorporates given schedules and personalizes study schedules for students, ensuring that they maintain a healthy school-life balance. Our web application is more than just a tool for keeping track of studentsâ€™ studies; it also determines the optimal time to study and facilitates the formation of peer study groups. By utilizing our web application, students will feel motivated to study, understand the significance of careful planning, and subsequently enhance their time management abilities.</p>

                    <h2>App Description</h2>
                    <p>The users of this application will be students, particularly those who struggle to manage their time to study and feel unmotivated to keep up with their coursework. The web application provides the following three features:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Upon launching the web application, users are prompted to a sign-up page where they must create an account and input their class schedule. Users must also answer some questions for the web application to personalize their study timetables. Based on the responses, the app generates the most optimal study timetable for the users. The users can edit the timetable should they wish to do it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Users can create study groups or join existing ones by browsing the application. They can filter the groups based on classes.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Users can add friends and share their timetables with one another. When they share the timetables, they can remind each other of due dates and organize study sessions based on time availability.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>As users keep track of their academics through this application, they will improve their time management skills. Moreover, study sessions with peers will provide an environment where students can feel motivated and comfortable while studying.</p>
